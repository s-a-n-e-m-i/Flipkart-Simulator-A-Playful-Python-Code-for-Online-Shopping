This Python code simulates a simplified online shopping experience on Flipkart, allowing you to explore the checkout and payment process.

Features:

Item Selection: Choose from a variety of in-stock items (shoes, shirts, pants) with their respective quantities and prices.
Shopping Cart: Add items to your cart and view the running total.
Checkout: Proceed to secure payment options including COD, PhonePe/GPay, and Debit Card.
UPI and Debit Card PIN Validation: Simulate PIN verification for added realism (limited attempts).
Order Return and Cancellation: Change your mind? You can return items or cancel the order before payment.
Disclaimer:

This code is for educational and entertainment purposes only. It does not interact with the actual Flipkart website or process real transactions. Sensitive information like UPI PINs and debit card details would never be stored or transmitted in a practical implementation.
